feat: Implement batch processing and enhance documentation

This commit introduces a comprehensive batch processing feature that allows `purl_diver` to process multiple PE files within a directory in a single run. The implementation is robust, cross-platform, and highly configurable.

Key Changes:

1.  **Batch Processing Engine:**
    *   Added a new `batch_processor` module (`src/batch_processor.c` and `include/batch_processor.h`) to encapsulate all batch-related logic.
    *   Implemented cross-platform directory traversal for Windows (using `FindFirstFile`/`FindNextFile`) and Unix-like systems (using `opendir`/`readdir`).
    *   The core extraction logic in `main.c` was refactored into a reusable `extract_shellcode_internal` function to be called by both single-file and batch modes.

2.  **New Command-Line Options:**
    *   `--batch <dir>`: Enables batch mode on a specified directory.
    *   `--batch-output-dir <dir>`: Specifies a custom output directory for extracted files.
    *   `--batch-recursive`: Enables recursive traversal of subdirectories.
    *   `--batch-pattern <pattern>`: Filters files based on a comma-separated list of patterns (e.g., `"*.exe,*.dll"`).
    *   `--batch-log <file>`: Writes a detailed log of successful and failed extractions.
    *   `--batch-format <format>`: Sets a uniform output format for all files in the batch job.

3.  **Code Refinements & Fixes:**
    *   Resolved a "unused parameter" compilation warning in `extract_shellcode_internal` by removing the unnecessary parameter.
    *   Moved the `OutputFormat` enum from `options.h` to `pe_types.h` to resolve a circular dependency issue that caused build failures.
    *   Updated the `Makefile` to include the new `batch_processor.c` in the build process.

4.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `README.md` with a new "Batch Processing" section, providing clear examples for all new command-line options.
    *   Overhauled `DOCS/USAGE.md` to provide a complete and accurate reference for all general, filtering, and batch-processing command-line flags.

This feature significantly enhances the utility of `purl_diver`, making it a powerful tool for large-scale malware analysis and shellcode extraction.
