Improve PE Shellcode Extractor with comprehensive enhancements from SUGGESTIONS.md

This commit implements all suggested improvements from SUGGESTIONS.md:

High Priority:
- Fixed section overlap detection ordering issue by sorting sections before processing to prevent missed overlaps
- Added comprehensive unit/integration tests for entropy calculation and hash functions

Medium Priority:
- Enhanced error handling with improved validation for --min-size parameter using strtoul with overflow protection
- Added global cleanup function with atexit registration for proper resource management
- Improved interactive mode error handling to return proper error codes
- Replaced all strdup calls with custom my_strdup implementation for better portability
- Added RFC/FIPS references to hash implementations (MD5/RFC 1321, SHA256/FIPS PUB 180-4)
- Added Valgrind support and security compilation flags to Makefile

Low Priority:
- Implemented default output filename generation when none specified (input + ".shellcode.bin")
- Fixed all compilation warnings to ensure clean build with -Werror
- Added proper function declarations and unused parameter suppression

The tool now handles edge cases better, has improved memory safety, maintains backward compatibility, and follows best practices for cross-platform compatibility.
