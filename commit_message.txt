feat: Complete modularization and update documentation

This commit finalizes the transition to a fully modular architecture by removing the last pieces of duplicated code from the legacy `purl_diver.c` file.

Key changes:
- Removed duplicated PE header definitions, `PE_Context` struct, and several parsing/utility functions from `src/purl_diver.c` to resolve all "multiple definition" linker errors.
- Added `#include "utils.h"` where needed to link to the centralized `my_strdup` implementation.
- The `purl_diver` executable is now built cleanly from the modular sources defined in the `Makefile`.
- Updated `README.md` and `DOCS/USAGE.md` to reflect the new executable name (`purl_diver`), global installation instructions, and updated command-line examples.
- The legacy monolithic `extract_shellcode.c` and the now-refactored `src/purl_diver.c` are no longer part of the primary build, completing the refactoring process.
