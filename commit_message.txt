fix: correct cryptographic bugs, harden security, and add hash unit tests

Comprehensive hardening pass fixing real bugs, removing UB, and adding a
verified test harness for the MD5 and SHA-256 implementations.

Cryptographic fixes:
  - hash_algorithms.c: MD5 was missing the left-rotation step entirely
    (RFC 1321 §3.4); added s[64] rotation-amounts table and ROTL macro
  - hash_algorithms.c: SHA-256 message-schedule loading used plain
    `unsigned char << N` which is signed-integer UB under -O2; added
    explicit uint32_t casts throughout md5_process_block and
    sha256_process_block

Security / correctness fixes:
  - pe_parser.c: integer overflow in entry-point bounds check
    (VirtualAddress + VirtualSize could wrap); restructured to subtract
    after the >= guard
  - pe_parser.c: section raw-data bounds check now tests size before
    subtraction to prevent underflow
  - options.c: replaced atoi() with strtol() for --min-size; rejects
    negative values, non-numeric input, and values exceeding UINT32_MAX
  - output_formats.c: JSON printer escaped only \n \r \t; all control
    characters < 0x20 are now emitted as \uXXXX per RFC 8259
  - batch_processor.c: snprintf return value checked; paths that would
    overflow the buffer are skipped with a warning instead of silently
    truncated

Maintainability:
  - options.c / output_formats.c: added parse_output_format() helper;
    --format and --batch-format both use it, eliminating duplicated
    strcmp chains
  - section_analyzer.c / utils.c / output_formats.c: replaced all
    manual memcpy section-name extractions with safe_copy_section_name()
  - options.h: int verbose declared extern once; definition moved to
    options.c; removed redundant extern declarations from pe_parser.h,
    section_analyzer.h, import_export_analyzer.h
  - import_export_analyzer.c: rewritten with private SectionCacheEntry
    cache built once per call for better locality; internal static
    helpers accept pre-computed section info; public functions parse
    headers exactly once

Build system:
  - Makefile: moved -lm from CFLAGS to LDFLAGS; added -Wshadow
    -Wstrict-prototypes -Wformat=2; switched to per-file object
    compilation with automatic header-dependency tracking (-MMD -MP);
    added test_hash target; clean removes .o and .d files

Tests:
  - tests/test_hash.c: new unit-test binary covering MD5 and SHA-256
    against seven known-good vectors (empty string, "abc", "message
    digest", 55×'a', 64×'a', 1000×'a', "The quick brown fox..."),
    cross-verified with sha256sum / md5sum and Python hashlib
  - test_suite.sh: rewritten with pass/fail counters; JSON output
    validated via python3 -m json.tool; added --min-size rejection
    tests, --format rejection test, truncated-PE test, and non-PE
    file test

Documentation:
  - docs/BUILD.md: complete rewrite; Makefile is now primary build
    path; manual commands updated to include src/batch_processor.c on
    all platforms
  - docs/USAGE.md: clarified --format accepted aliases (c-array,
    hex-dump); documented that --min-size rejects negative/non-numeric
    input; updated --include/--exclude to note multiple use
  - README.md: corrected module count (9 → 10); replaced -Werror badge
    with accurate warning flags; replaced non-existent make asan with
    make debug; added make test / make test_hash to target list;
    updated optimization table to reflect actual changes
  - CLAUDE.md: created root-level guidance file replacing outdated
    docs/CLAUDE.md
